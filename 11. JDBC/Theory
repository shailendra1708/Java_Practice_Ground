JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) is a Java API that allows you to connect to a wide variety of databases, issue SQL queries, and manage results in Java applications. It provides a standard interface for interacting with relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and many others. JDBC is part of Java’s standard library (`java.sql` package) and is widely used in enterprise applications for database operations.

### Key Components of JDBC

1. **DriverManager**: This class manages a list of database drivers and establishes a connection between a Java application and a database using the appropriate driver.
   
2. **Connection**: Represents a session with a specific database. You use this to issue SQL statements and get results from the database.
   
3. **Statement**: Used to execute static SQL queries. There are three main types:
   - `Statement`: For general SQL queries.
   - `PreparedStatement`: Precompiled SQL queries, useful for preventing SQL injection and improving performance.
   - `CallableStatement`: For calling stored procedures in a database.

4. **ResultSet**: Represents the result of executing a SQL query. It is essentially a table of data representing rows and columns from the database.

5. **SQLException**: An exception that provides information about database access errors or other errors related to JDBC.

### Steps for Using JDBC

1. **Load the JDBC Driver**
   ```java
   Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"); // For MySQL
   ```

2. **Establish a Connection**
   ```java
   String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
   String user = "username";
   String password = "password";
   Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
   ```

3. **Create a Statement**
   ```java
   Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
   ```

4. **Execute Queries**
   - **For SELECT queries**:
     ```java
     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");
     while (rs.next()) {
         System.out.println(rs.getString("username"));
     }
     ```
   - **For INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries**:
     ```java
     int rowsAffected = stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('user1', 'pass1')");
     ```

5. **Close the Resources**
   ```java
   rs.close();
   stmt.close();
   connection.close();
   ```

### Example Code
Here’s a complete example demonstrating basic JDBC operations:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class JDBCDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
        String user = "username";
        String password = "password";

        try {
            // 1. Load the driver (optional in modern versions)
            Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

            // 2. Establish a connection
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

            // 3. Create a statement
            Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();

            // 4. Execute a query
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM users");

            // 5. Process the results
            while (rs.next()) {
                System.out.println("User: " + rs.getString("username"));
            }

            // 6. Clean up
            rs.close();
            stmt.close();
            connection.close();

        } catch (SQLException | ClassNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Types of JDBC Drivers
1. **JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver (Type 1)**: Bridges JDBC to ODBC. Deprecated.
2. **Native-API Driver (Type 2)**: Converts JDBC calls into database-specific calls using native code.
3. **Network Protocol Driver (Type 3)**: Translates JDBC calls into a database-independent protocol, which is then converted by a middleware server.
4. **Thin Driver (Type 4)**: Directly converts JDBC calls to the database-specific protocol without any middleware. This is the most commonly used type.

### Best Practices:
- **Use `PreparedStatement`** to avoid SQL injection and improve performance.
- **Always close resources** (`ResultSet`, `Statement`, `Connection`) in a `finally` block or use try-with-resources.
- **Batch Processing**: Use batch processing for executing multiple queries to improve performance when inserting or updating multiple records.
