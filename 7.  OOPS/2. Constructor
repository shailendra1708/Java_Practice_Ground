In Java, a constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type (not even void).

Key Characteristics of Constructors:

 1. Name: Must have the same name as the class.
 2. No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type.
 3. Automatic Call: Automatically called when an object is created.


Types of Constructors:

1. Default Constructor (No-Argument Constructor):
   If no constructor is defined in the class, the Java compiler automatically provides a default constructor.

2. Parameterized Constructor:    
   Takes arguments to initialize the object with specific values.
    Useful when you want to create objects with different initial values.


Constructor Chaining:
   Constructor chaining is a technique where one constructor calls another constructor in the same class or a superclass.

   1.Use this() to call another constructor in the same class.
   2.Use super() to call a constructor from the superclass.


Constructor Overloading : You can have multiple constructors in a single class, each with a different parameter list (overloading).
