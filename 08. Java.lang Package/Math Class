The Math class in Java is part of the java.lang package and provides various mathematical operations and constants. It includes methods for basic arithmetic, trigonometry, exponential, logarithmic functions, and more. You don't need to import the Math class explicitly because it's automatically imported by default in all Java programs.

Here’s an overview of some key aspects of the Math class:

1. Basic Arithmetic Functions: 

1.1 Math.abs(x): Returns the absolute value of x.
1.2 Math.max(x, y): Returns the larger of x and y.
1.3 Math.min(x, y): Returns the smaller of x and y.
1.4 Math.sqrt(x): Returns the square root of x.
1.5 Math.pow(x, y): Returns x raised to the power of y.


2. Rounding and Precision:

2.1 Math.ceil(x): Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
2.2 Math.floor(x): Returns the largest integer less than or equal to x.
2.3 Math.round(x): Rounds x to the nearest integer.
2.4 Math.rint(x): Returns the closest double to x, rounding to an even number in case of a tie.


3. Trigonometric Functions:

3.1 Math.sin(x): Returns the sine of x (in radians).
3.2 Math.cos(x): Returns the cosine of x (in radians).
3.3 Math.tan(x): Returns the tangent of x (in radians).
3.4 Math.toRadians(degrees): Converts an angle measured in degrees to an equivalent angle in  radians.
3.5 Math.toDegrees(radians): Converts an angle measured in radians to an equivalent angle in degrees.


4. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:

4.1 Math.exp(x): Returns e raised to the power of x.
4.2 Math.log(x): Returns the natural logarithm (base e) of x.
4.3 Math.log10(x): Returns the base-10 logarithm of x.


5. Random Numbers:

Math.random(): Returns a random number between 0.0 and 1.0.

You can also generate a random number in a specific range using:

// important
int randomNum = (int) (Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);


6. Other Useful Functions: 

6.1 Math.cbrt(x): Returns the cube root of x.
6.2 Math.hypot(x, y): Returns sqrt(x² + y²) without intermediate overflow or underflow.
6.3 Math.copySign(x, y): Returns x with the sign of y.


public class MathExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double a = 9.0;
        double b = 2.0;

        System.out.println("Square root of 9: " + Math.sqrt(a));
        System.out.println("9 raised to the power of 2: " + Math.pow(a, b));
        System.out.println("Absolute value of -5: " + Math.abs(-5));
        System.out.println("Max of 9 and 2: " + Math.max(a, b));
        System.out.println("Random number between 0 and 1: " + Math.random());
    }
}


The Math class is a versatile tool for performing all kinds of mathematical calculations in Java.
